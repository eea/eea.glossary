<skos:definition>Nitrogen, total(organic and inorganic) is not a single chemical substance but a wide range of compounds of nitrogen which can be used directly by plants as a source of nitrogen required for their nutrition directly, or else may be converted into forms that plants can use in the environment.Nitrogen gas makes up about 80% of the atmosphere and is fairly non-reactive. Before living organisms can make use of nitrogen as a nutrient element, it has to be in a soluble form, such as nitrate or ammonia (inorganic forms) or in organic forms such as proteins which are readily converted into inorganic forms. The key inorganic form of nitrogen is ammonia, a highly reactive gas in its pure form, but which is usually found as ammonium ions when dissolved in water. Ammonium ions are the form of nitrogen used by plants and animals to make amino acids which are then built up into the structural proteins and enzymes that are the key components of all living organisms. The other main inorganic form of nitrogen is the nitrate ion (derived from nitric acid). Nitrate and ammonia are inter-converted in the water and soil by micro-organisms. These inorganic forms are taken up by plants and converted to proteins. Higher animals could not use inorganic forms of nitrogen for their nutrition but instead depend on organic forms already made by the plants and other animals that they eat. Proteins in the animal diet are first broken down into their constituent amino acids and are then reassembled into the required animal proteins and other cell constituents. Waste organic nitrogen compounds in animals are converted into ammonia, and then excreted in the urine as urea and other simple organic forms. These substances then enter the environment where they are converted into nitrate, ammonium ions and nitrogen gas. Some specialised bacteria can also &apos;fix&apos; nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into ammonium ions. The above process is called the nitrogen cycle. In addition to ammonium and nitrate ions, traces of unstable inorganic nitrogen compounds such as nitrite ions may occasionally be found.

Other members of the family include the chlorophenols, which tend to be far more persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative than non-chlorinated phenols.Phenols and its close relatives are widely distributed in nature, being produced naturally by plants and animals including humans. Naturally occurring phenols account for the flavour and colour of certain foods. Aspirin is derived from a natural plant phenol salicyclic acid. Phenols are also used by plants to make lignin, the main natural polymer in wood. Chlorinated phenols are believed to be almost entirely man-made in origin.

<skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Phosphorus, total</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:definition>Inorganic phosphates are compounds of phosphorus and oxygen that occur in many forms and are usually combined with other elements. Phosphoric acid, the common acid of phosphorus, is the main commercial source of inorganic phosphate compounds. Phosphoric acid is made by treating calcium phosphate rock, such as apatite, with sulfuric acid.Phosphoric acid is usually stored and sold as a solution. It is a brown/green viscous liquid with a slight acid odour. It is tribasic, having three replaceable hydrogen atoms. Phosphates are products formed by the replacement of some or all of the hydrogen of phosphoric acid by metals, such as sodium, potassium, calcium and aluminium.

<skos:definition>Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAH) are a very large number of naturally occurring and man-made chemicals. The pure compounds are white or yellowish crystalline solids. They are insoluble in water but dissolve readily in fats and oils. Well-known PAHs are the compounds benzo[a]pyrene, fluoranthene, naphthaline or anthracene.

Sulphur trioxide (SO3) is an intermediate product during the manufacture of sulphuric acid (contact process).Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas with a penetrating, choking odour. It dissolves readily in water to form an acidic solution (sulphurous acid) and is about 2.5 times heavier than air. [definition source: dataservice, http://dataservice.eea.eu.int]</skos:definition>

<skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Total Organic Carbon (TOC)</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:definition>All of the organic (carbon-containing) substances in natural waters may be termed TOC. There are many natural and man-made substances that all contribute to TOC. TOC is partly broken down by micro-organisms, in the process consuming oxygen. At high TOC concentrations, so much oxygen in the water may be used up that there is not enough to support fish and other aquatic animals, which then die.TOC can be measured directly in samples of water by treating it with chemical oxidants and then measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released. Alternatively it can be measured by determining how much oxygen it uses up during its complete oxidation to carbon dioxide. This is expressed in terms of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). On an average the ratio COD/TOC is about 3:1. [definition source: dataservice, http://dataservice.eea.eu.int]</skos:definition>
